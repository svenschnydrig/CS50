sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: It's the slowest because it's in reverse order and therefore needs many steps to bubble all numbers to the right side

reversed 50'000
real    0m5.479s
user    0m5.010s
sys     0m0.202s


sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: Because it's the fastest

reversed 50'000
real    0m0.446s
user    0m0.035s
sys     0m0.182s

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: Speed is between bubble sort and merge sort
